# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Conversion

An interactive classroom presentation by Team A, paced for approximately 90 seconds.

## Open the presentation

Download this repository and open `index.html` in a web browser. The presentation is self-contained and requires no installation or build step.

Use **Next slide**, **Previous**, or the keyboard arrow keys to navigate. Click **Reveal answer** and **Reverse-check** to show the working and verification. Expand **Speaker notes / 90-second rehearsal** for the presentation script.

## Six conversion cases

1. Decimal 45 to binary: `101101`.
2. Decimal 173 to binary and hexadecimal: `10101101` and `AD`.
3. Binary `1100110` to decimal: 102.
4. Hexadecimal `3F` to decimal: 63.
5. Decimal 0 to eight-bit binary: `00000000`.
6. Decimal 256 to eight-bit unsigned binary: out of range. Its binary representation, `100000000`, requires nine bits.

The presentation includes division tables, four-bit nibble grouping, place-value expansion, reverse checks, and the AI prompt for the same six cases.

## Interactive error demonstration

On the eight-bit limit slide, compare **Try 255** with **Try 256**. The discarded-bit example shows why removing the extra bit changes 256 to zero. The converter should reject values outside the unsigned eight-bit range of 0 to 255.

## Optional GitHub Pages hosting

In this repository's GitHub **Settings**, open **Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, then select the `main` branch and the root folder. GitHub will provide the presentation's live URL after deployment.
